This repository will serve as the main repository for my individual enterprise Java project.

Problem Statement

For the last 8 years that I have played the White Wolf Tabletop game I have done it all through a manualy process of rolling dice, writing on paper and keeping tedious on the side notes for my character sheets. The site that I will be creating will aid in the process of maintaining a character sheet, facilitate a session between players with a chat services that will be used to perform and log dice rolls. The charact sheet involes a wide array of variables that make up the fictional character come to life while you are playing the game. These are all liable to change throughout the session so they will have to be represented in a flexible database in order to react to changes. The added benifit of this site is that multiple people will be able to log in and then see each other dice rolls and chat and share character sheet information throughout the session.
